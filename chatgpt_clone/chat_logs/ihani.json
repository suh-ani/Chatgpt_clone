Sample-weighted loss: This allows the network to focus on learning high-weight samples while ignoring low-weight ones.\n2. Deconvolution layers: These are used to upscale feature maps and allow the network to predict objects of multiple scales.\n3. Invert Multi-Class Invert Adaboost (IMCIA): This algorithm is used to reduce the influence of possible noise in the network by decreasing the weights of noisy samples.\n\nThe paper presents a detailed description of the SWIPENet architecture, its components, and the sample-weighted loss function.

The report focuses on the admission process, eligibility criteria, and quality of education provided by both institutions.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Admission Process:** JNVST conducts a national-level entrance test online/offline, while RGNV organizes a state-level entrance test offline conducted by UBSE (Uttarakhand School Education Board).\n2. **Eligibility Criteria:** Both institutions require students to be between 9-13 years old and studying in Class V in a government or recognized school.\n3. **Residential Options:** JNVST offers free education for boys from General/OBC category, while RGNV provides 100% free residential schooling for all students.\n4. **Competition Level:** JNVST is highly competitive with lakhs of applicants per district, whereas RGNV has a moderate competition level with ~30-60 seats per district.\n5. **Curriculum:** Both institutions follow the CBSE curriculum.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Prospective parents/guardians should carefully evaluate their child's aptitude and interest in academics before applying to either institution.\n2. Students from rural areas may benefit from RGNV's focus on inclusion and equal opportunities for girls and rural students.\n3.
