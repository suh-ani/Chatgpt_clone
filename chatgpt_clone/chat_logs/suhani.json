The main components of the algorithm are:\n\n1. **Object Detection Model**: A single model, SWIPENeT, which is trained on the training set using a sample-weighted loss function.\n2. **Multi-Attention Mechanism**: The multi-attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different regions of the image for each class separately.\n\n**Key Steps:**\n\n1. Initialize object weights wj = 1 for all objects in the first iteration.\n2. Compute the weights of positive samples using a mapping function f(\u00afwm) that maps the weight of an object to its corresponding ensemble model weight.\n3. Decrease the weights of undetected objects and increase the weights of detected objects using the same mapping function f(\u00afwm).\n4. Train the m-th SWIPENeT Gm on the training set using the updated weights.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for M iterations.\n\n**Output:**\n\nThe final output is a detection results D, which includes the class (cls), score (score), and coordinates (cx, cy, w, h) of each detected box.\n\nNote that the IMA algorithm uses a combination of multiple models to achieve better performance, but the exact implementation details are not provided in the given context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "search news"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Google News: https://news.google.com/\n\nCNN: Breaking News, Latest News and Videos: https://www.cnn.com/\n\nYahoo News: Latest and Breaking News, Headlines, Live ...: https://news.yahoo.com/"}, {"role": "user", "content": "generate image of a lady sweeping floor"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's your generated image:"}, {"role": "user", "content": "generate image of american couple holding hands"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's your generated image:"}, {"role": "user", "content": "generate image of american couple holding hands with their faces"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's your generated image:"}, {"role": "user", "content": "generate image of american couple holding hands with their faces"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's your generated image:"}, {"role": "user", "content": "generate image of temple underwater"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's your generated image:"}, {"role": "user", "content": "generate image of a dog playing"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's your generated image:"}, {"role": "user", "content": "generate image of a baby crying"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's your generated image:"}, {"role": "user", "content": "generate image of a girl eating ice cream"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's your generated image:"}, {"role": "user", "content": "generate image of a couple sitting along river"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's your generated image:"}, {"role": "user", "content": "generate image of a man proposing a girl"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's your generated image:"}, {"role": "user", "content": "generate image of horse"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's your generated image:"}, {"role": "user", "content": "generate image of lion"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's your generated image:"}, {"role": "user", "content": "generate image of full lion"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's your generated image:"}, {"role": "user", "content": "generate image of peacock"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's your generated image:"}, {"role": "user", "content": "generate image of full peacock"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's your generated image:"}, {"role": "user", "content": "generate image of boy proposing girl"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's your generated image:"}]
